### what this is

"Mapping the pigeon complaints of New York City, 2010 - early 2016"

This is a little side project from my class 
[Foundations of Data Science](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science). It's done in R, to explore the spatial libraries and work with shapefiles, as well as publicly available data from New York City. 


### how this came about

I came across a dataset in Jeremy Singer-Vine's [weekly email](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), comprised of all reported rat sightings in New York City. Going further I found a _wealth of data_ on complaints made to various NYC agencies, all through the 311 Service Requests system. [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/data) is a beautiful thing.

Filtering the data from the source using Socrata's API - limiting the results to _311 Service Requests - contains 'pigeon'_ - we have 3893 observations of 30 variables. Since [rats of New York have been amazingly well analyzed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157232/) - why not see what we can learn about pigeons?
