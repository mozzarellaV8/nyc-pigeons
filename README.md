#### Mapping the pigeon related complaints of New York City (2010 - early 2016)

I came across a dataset in Jeremy Singer-Vine's [weekly email](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), comprised of all reported rat sightings in New York City. Going further I found a _wealth of data_ on complaints made to various NYC agencies, all through the 311 Service Requests system. [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/data) is a beautiful thing.

So what this is is some initial exploration of R and working data for my class [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science). I'm new to all of this - github included - so any suggestions, criticisms, or complaints are welcome. Actually for complaints, you should just call 311. Thanks!~# nyc311-Pigeons
